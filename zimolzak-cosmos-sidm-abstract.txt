# Abstract

Background: Electronic triggers (e-triggers) have been used
extensively to find cases of diagnostic error in large databases, but
they have several limitations. First, they identify patterns that are
only suggestive---not definitive---of error. This means that e-trigger
predictive value is imperfect, and time-consuming manual chart review
is required to separate e-trigger outputs into true and false
instances of missed opportunities for diagnosis (MOD). Second,
e-triggers are often designed from first principles, rather than based
on empiric data patterns, so they may not detect all signals of MOD.
Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to enhance e-trigger
predictive value and emulate human chart reviewers at larger scale.
Therefore, we sought to create e-triggers with enhanced accuracy,
where records flagged by a first-stage traditional e-trigger are
further refined by a second-stage ML classifier into true and false
MODs.

Methods: Based on the input of an expert panel, we designed two
rules-based e-triggers to find possible MODs, in the emergency
department. First, we found cases of an index ER visit with dizziness
or vertigo, in patients with stroke risk factors, and discharge from
ER to home, followed by hospital admission for stroke or TIA within 30
days. Second, we found cases of an ER visit with abdominal pain, in
patients with abnormal temperature, and discharge from ER to home,
followed by hospital admission within 30 days. Trained clinicians
reviewed a random sample of charts flagged by the e-trigger and
labeled each as MOD or no MOD. Labeled charts were used for training
and test datasets for ML methods including regularized logistic
regression and random forests. ML had access to demographics, lab
values, vital signs, medications, test orders, and encounter
diagnoses.

Results: At national scale, the eCQM for lung EP was 19.5%. This is
similar to prior values (19% VA and 18% Geisinger). Survey data showed
an association of EP with transportation to medical appointments (43%
vs. 28%). There was a stepwise association of more EP with each
increasing category of social vulnerability (18% at lowest category
vs. 22% at highest).

Conclusions: We successfully implemented an eCQM using a different
platform for US medical record data. We
