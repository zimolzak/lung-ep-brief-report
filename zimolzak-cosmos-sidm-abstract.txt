# Abstract

Background: Electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) are
increasingly used. We previously developed one for cancer emergency
presentation. This is a unique measure because it focuses on diagnosis
specifically.

Methods: We implemented an eCQM in Cosmos, a deidentified database
covering $x$ million individuals. The interface is point and click
instead of SQL, which required using the original source document
English language description, a previously published approach that has
worked. We measured the crude measure nationwide in those with new
lung cancer diagnosis in calendar year 2019. Emergency presentation
was defined as ER visit followed by the new cancer diagnosis within 30
days. We examined associations with social determinants of health both
from survey and census ZIP code level data. We examined previous
associations with demographic factors.

Results: At national scale, the eCQM for lung EP was 19.5% (out of
58,274 cancer diagnoses). This is similar to prior values (19% VA and
18% Geisinger). Survey data showed an association of EP with
transportation to medical appointments (43% vs. 28%). There was a
stepwise association of more EP with each increasing category of
social vulnerability (18% at lowest category vs. 22% at highest).

Income showed etc etc

Demographics showed etc etc

Conclusions: We successfully implemented an eCQM using a different
platform for US medical record data. We validated previous demographic
associations shown in separate datasets. We showed associations with social
determinants data that were not available elsewhere and can be further
investigated. Limitations include the inability to conclusively
re-validate this measure due to deidentified data and no access to
text notes, although this could be done at any single institution that
wanted to implement the measure.
